I'm a first-year graduate student student from [Academy of Mathematics and System Science, CAS](http://www.amss.cas.cn). My research interest includes Deep Learning theory and AI4Science.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Shihua Zhang](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~zsh) of ZhangLab from [Academy of Mathematics and System Science, CAS](http://www.amss.cas.cn).Before that, I was advised by [Prof. Huaming Wu](http://cam.tju.edu.cn/homepage/wuhuaming/) from [School of mathematics, Tianjin university](http://math.tju.edu.cn).
